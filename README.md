# Best PNG (8-bit/Pixelated/Whatever) to SVG Converter

More useful for small/pixelated pngs that you want to scale while keep it crispy. Or just use "image-rendering": "pixelated".

It tries two methods. Horizontal lines and then blocks (still needs improvement). Whichever is the smallest will be choosen.

Sometimes the blocks method may not be perfect so in that case choose the horizontal lines method.
